# MangaVerse API Integration Fixes

## Issues Identified
1. Incorrect API key in NetworkModule.kt
2. MangaListResponse model didn't match the actual API response structure
3. MangaDto expected an integer ID, but the API returns a string ID
4. Missing fields in MangaDto (nsfw, type, total_chapter)
5. Incorrect endpoint paths in MangaApiService

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed API Key
- Updated the API key in NetworkModule.kt to match the correct key from Postman

### 2. Updated MangaListResponse Model
- Changed to match the actual API response structure
- Added code field instead of status and message
- Added calculated pagination fields since the API doesn't provide them

### 3. Updated MangaDto Model
- Changed ID field to handle string IDs
- Added missing fields (nsfw, type)
- Added a computed property to generate a numeric ID from the string ID for database compatibility
- Updated the toManga() method to handle the new fields

### 4. Updated MangaRepositoryImpl
- Added code to calculate pagination values since the API doesn't provide them
- Improved error handling and logging

### 5. Updated ApiTestActivity
- Enhanced logging to show more details about the API response
- Updated the UI to display more information about each manga

## Testing
- Created test scripts to verify the API connection
- Confirmed that the API is working correctly with the updated models

## Next Steps
1. Test the app thoroughly to ensure all features work with the real API data
2. Update any other components that might be affected by these changes
3. Consider adding more error handling for edge cases
